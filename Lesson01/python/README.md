# info for both projects

I use UV to run this project and Pytest is the test runner of my chose.

I run pytest with this command:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

## pytest notes

- in order for pytest to find the test files, the need to be start with "test_" followed by the file that needs to be tested.
- how to write in asserts in pytest (it uses python's build in assert)
- - assert doStuff() == "x", "message given if failed"
- each test is showed as a green dot '.' if it passed or a red "F" if it failed
